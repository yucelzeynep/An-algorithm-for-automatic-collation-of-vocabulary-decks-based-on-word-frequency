This program builds 2 decks of flash-cards with a desired difficulty relation.

For this example, we consider the cards to involve a country on the front side and 
its capital on the back.

We consider the -a priori- familiarity of the users to the capital to be in 
direct relation with the difficulty of concerning card.

This familiarity is considered to be proportional to the exposure of the users 
to the capitals in the news. Since our pool of subjects is entirely Japanese,
we rank the cards with respect to the number of Japanese Google news search results.

Please see [1] for achieving number of search results in Python. 

We organize the input file such that it includes the following columns, 
 col1: country in katakana 
 col2: capital in katakana 
 col3: country in English 
 col4: capital in English 
 col5: number of search results for country 
 col6: number of search results for capital

So as to achieve a desired level of relative difficulty, we adopt an approach based on 
Rank Bi-serial Correlation (RBSC). 

For a simple example on RBSC, please see rbsc_simple.py under this repository.

For further details on the algorithm, please refer to [2].
